# Disease-Diagnosis
This AI-powered web application helps users identify potential diseases based on their symptoms. After logging in and entering basic details, users select symptoms, and the system predicts the likely disease using a trained machine learning model. It also suggests a specialist, provides health advice (diet, precautions, exercise), and lists nearby hospitals. The tool supports early awareness but does not replace medicalÂ consultation.
